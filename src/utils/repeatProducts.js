// This utility function creates a large list of products by repeating the original list multiple times.
// You can specify how many times you want the products to repeat using the 'repeatCount' parameter.
// By default, it repeats the list 20 times. This is useful when you want to simulate a large dataset.

export const repeatProducts = (products, repeatCount = 20) => {
    return Array.from({ length: repeatCount }, (_, i) => 
      // Array.from creates an array of a given length (repeatCount).
      // In this case, the length is 20 (default value), but you can change it by passing a second argument.
      
      // We're mapping through the original 'products' list for each repetition.
      // In the first iteration (i = 0), we map over all products.
      // On the second iteration (i = 1), we again map over the same products, and so on.
      products.map(product => ({
        // For each product in the original list, we copy all of its properties.
        ...product,
  
        // Give each repeated product a unique 'id' to avoid duplication in React.
        // We're calculating the 'id' by using the iteration index (i) and multiplying it by the length of the products array.
        // This ensures that every product in each repetition gets a unique id.
        id: i * products.length + product.id,
      }))
    ).flat(); // The '.flat()' method flattens the resulting array of arrays into a single array.
    // Without this, we'd have an array of arrays, but we want one big array containing all the repeated products.
  }
  

//   Detailed Explanation:
// Array.from({ length: repeatCount }): This creates an array of a given length (set to repeatCount which defaults to 20). Each element of this array represents one repetition of the original product list.

// .map(product => {...}): Inside each repetition, the .map() function iterates over the original products array and makes a copy of each product with a unique ID. This is done for each repetition (i will increment for every cycle).

// id: i * products.length + product.id: This is how the unique id for each repeated product is generated. We ensure that IDs don't overlap by adding the multiplication factor (i * products.length) for each repetition.

// .flat(): Since Array.from produces an array of arrays (because map is called for each repetition), we use .flat() to merge those arrays into one single flat array.

// Result:
// If you have 5 original products and repeatCount = 20, the output will be an array of 100 products, where the original 5 products are repeated 20 times, each with a unique ID.
